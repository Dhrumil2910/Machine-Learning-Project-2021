# Machine-Learning-Project-2021

A PyTorch implementation of [Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04368.pdf)  

***TODO: Upload rest of the source code files.***


# Sample Summaries
Sample summaries generated by our model for 10,000 articles in the test dataset can be found in data/samples directory. The source articles are in file ***source_articles.txt***. It's corrosponding summaries are in the  ***source_summaries.txt*** file. And, the summaries generated by our model are in a file ***generated_summaries.txt***.
