# Machine-Learning-Project-2021

A PyTorch implementation of [Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04368.pdf)  

***TODO: Clean and comment rest of the remaining source code files.***


# Sample Summaries
Sample summaries generated by our model for 10,000 articles in the test dataset can be found in data/samples directory. The source articles are in file ***source_articles.txt***. It's corrosponding summaries are in the  ***source_summaries.txt*** file. And, the summaries generated by our model are in a file ***generated_summaries.txt***.

All the three files have 10,000 lines each (assuming line wrap is turned off). An article on line 1 in the ***source_articles.txt*** has its summary on line 1 in ***source_summaries.txt*** and the summary generated by the model on line 1 in the ***generated_summaries.txt*** so on and so forth.
